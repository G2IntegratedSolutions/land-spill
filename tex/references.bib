abstract = {Diffusion wave equation describes the flood wave propagation which is used in solving overland and open channel flow problems. Therefore, it is important to understand and solve the diffusion wave equations accurately. For this purpose, researchers have previously developed several analytical and numerical methods for the solution of the partial differential equation of diffusion waves. The solution derived by Kazezyi{\{}dotless{\}}lmaz-Alhan and Medina (2007) [12] can be used to solve overland flow problems during rainfall events with both constant and variable rainfall intensity, and with constant hydraulic diffusivity and wave celerity. In this paper, this method is improved by employing the De Hoog algorithm instead of Stehfest algorithm for Laplace inversion and adapting the solution to variable hydraulic diffusivity and wave celerity. In addition, the performances of the Stehfest and the De Hoog algorithms are compared. Synthetic examples are solved by using both Stehfest and De Hoog algorithms incorporated into the existing analytical solution to present the accuracy of the De Hoog algorithm over the Stehfest algorithm. The examples are also solved by using the new method in order to demonstrate the improvement over the existing method. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@techreport{HEC-11993,
abstract = {This document discusses the application of the kinematic wave routing method in the Flood Hydrograph Package (HEC-1) for analyzing urban runoff processes. The material is presented in two chapters and a comprehensive example. Chapter 1 presents introductory material necessary for an understanding of the theory, assumptions, equations and numerical methods incorporated into HEC-1 for kinematic wave flood routing. The physical processes of the urban runoff and streamflow routing are discussed briefly and related to the kinematic wave capabilities in HEC-1. Chapter 2 explains methods of applying kinematic wave routing techniques using HEC-1. Data requirements along with specific methods of applying kinematic wave routing techniques to runoff problems in urban hydrology are discussed. The chapters have been prepared so the user can either read one or both. A user interested only in the theory, or only in application procedures, can read the appropriate chapter. The basic approach for the subdivision of the basin into the various elements listed here was developed and coded through discussions with John Peters, Art Pabst, and Paul Ely of the Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC). The original development and programming of the kinematic wave routing routines in computer program HEC-1 was done under contract by Resource Analysis, Incorporated, under the direction of Dr. Brendan Harley. Subsequently, David Goldman modified the computational scheme so that the solution of the kinematic wave equations is more stable and provides the user with information on the accuracy of the solution. Robert MacArthur originally wrote Chapter 1, and Johannes J. DeVries originally wrote Chapter 2. Paul Detjens modified Chapters 1 and 2 to reflect the changes made to the program. He also created a new example, Appendix A, which demonstrates the use of the kinematic wave option. Troy Nicolini was instrumental in organizing this version of TD-10.},

abstract = {Modeling of the rainfall-runoff process is of both scientific and practical significance. Many of the currently used mathematical models of hydrologic systems were developed a genera tion ago. Much of the effort since then has focused on refining these models rather than on developing new models based on improved scientific understanding. In the past few years, however, a renewed effort has been made to improve both our fundamental understanding of hydrologic processes and to exploit technological advances in computing and remote sensing. It is against this background that the NATO Advanced Study Institute on Recent Advances in the Modeling of Hydrologic Systems was organized. The idea for holding a NATO ASI on this topic grew out of an informal discussion between one of the co-directors and Professor Francisco Nunes-Correia at a previous NATO ASI held at Tucson, Arizona in 1985. The Special Program Panel on Global Transport Mechanisms in the Geo-Sciences of the NATO Scientific Affairs Division agreed to sponsor the ASI and an organizing committee was formed. The committee comprised the co directors, Professor David S. Bowles (U.S.A.) and Professor P. Enda O'Connell (U.K.), and Professor Francisco Nunes-Correia (Portugal), Dr. Donn G. DeCoursey (U.S.A.), and Professor Ezio Todini (Italy).},

abstract = {In this paper, a screening model for flow of a nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) and associated chemical transport in the vadose zone is developed. The model is based on kinematic approximation of the governing equations for both the NAPL and a partitionable chemical constituent. The resulting governing equation is a first- order, quasi-linear hyperbolic equation to which the generalized method of characteristics can be applied. This approach generally neglects the contribution to the NAPL flux from capillary pressure gradients. During infiltration under ponded conditions, or when the NAPL flux exceeds the maximum effective conductivity of the soil, the effect of capillary suction is included in the model through the usage of the Green-Ampt model. All of the resulting model equations are in the form of ordinary differential equations which are solved numerically by a variable time step Runge-Kutta technique. Results from a simple column experiment were used to evaluate the vadose zone flow model assumptions. Independently measured parameters allow simulation without calibration of the model results. The match of the model to the data suggests that the model captures the qualitative behavior of the excapable of an acceptable degree of quantitative agreemen},

@article{Ponchaut2011,
abstract = {The recent publication of evaluation protocols for vapor source term models and vapor dispersion models have influenced the modeling approaches that can be used for approval of new and expansion projects at LNG receiving terminals. In the past few years the scientific basis of integral vapor source term models has been questioned with growing concerns regarding their validity. In this paper, the shallow water equations (SWEs) were solved to study the characteristics of the evaporating LNG pool associated with a constant flow rate spill of LNG into a concrete sump. In the early stages of pool spreading, the leading edge thickness profile of the SWE model scales with the square root of the distance from the leading edge as the pool spreads. After the edge of the pool reaches the wall, the reflected wave forms a hydraulic jump that travels back towards the center of the pool at a speed that is considerably slower than the initial spreading of the pool. Once the hydraulic jump reaches the center, the pool assumes a nearly flat free surface for the rest of the spill. The pool spreading and the rate of evaporation from the SWEs were then compared to the solution provided by the integral model, PHAST. The two approaches were found to agree well with one another. The SWE model was also used to demonstrate the influence of an elevated spill source. With an elevated source, the LNG pool spreads faster, significantly increasing the initial rate of vaporization and peak vaporization rate. This increase in the initial rate of vaporization could lead to an increase in the vapor cloud hazard distance. The SWE model was also used to demonstrate the influence of an inclined sump floor in the shape of an inverted cone where the spilling LNG accumulates in the low vertex of the cone. Inclined sump floors can be used to significantly reduce the cumulative evaporation, making them attractive as a possible mitigation approach in cases where a containment sump is located close to a property boundary. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This model allows modelling of hortonian overland flow and infiltration during complex rainfall events. Original procedures have been developed in order to simulate complex rainfall events on natural slopes. The accuracy of the results is tested by comparison with experimental field data on the basis of calibrated soil and surface friction parameters. Good agreement between the calculated result and the measured data was found. The scheme proposed was found to be appropriate. The results of tests presented illustrate the effect of microtopography on the distribution of the flow depths, the magnitude and direction of flow velocities and infiltration depths.

abstract = {The spreading of a two-dimensional, viscous gravity current propagating over and draining into a deep porous substrate is considered both theoretically and experimen- tally. We first determine analytically the rate of drainage of a one-dimensional layer of fluid into a porous bed and find that the theoretical predictions for the downward rate of migration of the fluid front are in excellent agreement with our laboratory experiments. The experiments suggest a rapid and simple technique for the determi- nation of the permeability of a porous medium. We then combine the relationships for the drainage of liquid from the current through the underlying medium with a formalism for its forward motion driven by the pressure gradient arising from the slope of its free surface. For the situation in which the volume of fluid V fed to the current increases at a rate proportional to t3, where t is the time since its initiation, the shape of the current takes a self-similar form for all time and its length is pro- portional to t2. When the volume increases less rapidly, in particular for a constant volume, the front of the gravity current comes to rest in finite time as the effects of fluid drainage into the underlying porous medium become dominant. In this case, the runout length is independent of the coefficient of viscosity of the current, which sets the time scale of the motion. We present numerical solutions of the governing partial differential equations for the constant-volume case and find good agreement with our experimental data obtained from the flow of glycerine over a deep layer of spherical beads in air.},

We review the theoretical basis for modelling floodplain flow with simplified hydraulic treatments based on a dimensional analysis of the one-dimensional shallow water equations. We then review how such schemes can be applied in practice and consider issues of space discretization, time discretization and model parameterisation, before going on to consider model assessment procedures. We show that a key advantage of reduced complexity codes is that they force modellers to think about the minimum process representation necessary to predict particular quantities and act as a check on any tendency to reductionism. At the same time, however, the use (compared to standard hydraulic codes) of strong simplifying assumptions requires us to also address the question "how simple can a model be and still be physically realistic?" We show that by making explicit this debate about acceptable levels of abstraction, reduced complexity codes allow progress to be made in addressing a number of long-standing debates in hydraulics. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The ability to measure, predict, and compute tsunami flow velocities is of importance in risk assessment and hazard mitigation. Substantial damage can be done by high velocity flows, particularly in harbors and bays, even when the wave height is small. Moreover, advancing the study of sediment transport and tsunami deposits depends on the accurate interpretation and modeling of tsunami flow velocities and accelerations. Until recently, few direct measurements of tsunami velocities existed to compare with model results. During the 11 March 2011 Tohoku Tsunami 328 current meters were in place around the Hawaiian Islands, USA, that captured time series of water velocity in 18 locations, in both harbors and deep channels, at a series of depths. We compare several of these velocity records against numerical simulations performed using the GeoClaw numerical tsunami model, based on solving the depth-averaged shallow water equations with adaptive mesh refinement, to confirm that this model can accurately predict velocities at nearshore locations. Model results demonstrate tsunami current velocity is more spatially variable than wave form or height and therefore may be a more sensitive variable for model validation.},

abstract = {Spills occur wherever people handle liquids. Understanding spills can give insights into activities at facilities where liquids are being handled. This work looks at the relationship between the area of a spill and the volume spilled on a permeable soil surface. The spreading of a liquid spill depends on its physical characteristics and on the surface properties. In some circumstances, it may be possible to help identify an unknown liquid involved in a spill by observing its spreading behavior. This experimental work improves and validates the predictive capability of a previously developed model. At this stage of the research on spills, only smooth, inclined, sample soil surfaces are studied with an emphasis placed on spills of non-aqueous or organic liquids associated with motor vehicle use (e.g., antifreeze, transmission fluid, brake fluid). This work achieves a better understanding of non-aqueous liquid spill behavior on soils. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory performed experiments to test the validity of a mathematical spill model for predicting the simultaneous over-surface flow and liquid infiltration into a soil substrate. Both water-miscible and water-immiscible liquids were spilled on tilted smooth soil surfaces. The spilled liquids covered a range of physical properties defined by their viscosity, density, and surface tension. The example liquids are water-diluted corn syrup, pump oil, antifreeze coolant, and dodecane (a purified form of kerosene or jet fuel). The soils investigated are a sand and a silt loam, constituting a descriptive range of typical soil properties. Infiltration rate into the sand is high, whereas the silt loam is much less permeable. Experiments were conducted at a smaller 30-centimeter size scale and a larger mesoscale of approximately 1 meter to compare the influence of scale on spill progression. The spill model depends on the simplified Green-Ampt equation defined in section four to describe infiltration into a soil. A number of methods were employed for both measuring infiltration and optimizing the model fit to investigate different calibration procedures. A fluid-media scaling principle is applied to estimate the model parameters for different liquids, based on infiltration information for a standard liquid, usually water. Using the Green-Ampt infiltration model made it possible to avoid implementing a more mechanistically complex multiphase simulator coupled to the over-surface spill propagation model. Moreover, using the Green-Ampt model avoided a more complicated parameter representation of non-aqueous liquid flow in soils. Thus, the Green-Ampt model is demonstrated to simplify the modeling of vertical infiltration. The progression of spills on soil surfaces during experiments is captured using digital photography. Conversion of pixels to area allowed the measurement of spill surface area progression. Water-diluted corn syrup spills on sand at tilts of 2.4 degrees and 4.8 degrees produced similar total spill areas and infiltration times but had differing spill shapes. Spill shape became more elongated with increasing tilt, as predicted in previously reported model runs. Experimental spill areas were largely dependent on soil permeability and liquid viscosity, with larger spill areas being produced as soil permeability decreased and liquid viscosity increased. Irregularly shaped (non-elliptical) spills produced areas nearly equal to those of replicate spills having more regular patterns. Some liquid spills infiltrated irregularly over the spreading area as a result of variability in hydraulic properties of the soil pack, even though care was taken to produce a uniform soil pack. An important observation is that spills tended to produce a fingershaped protrusion at the down-slope edge as they progressed. This feature's formation is believed to be iv related to surface tension causing contraction of the spill's width at its leading edge A lack of soil wetting at a spill's leading edge may also contribute to the development of a finger frontal protrusion. Model simulations of spill experiments accurately predicted spill area when soil parameters were appropriately adjusted or calibrated. The maximum error in predicted spill areas ranged from 4{\%} to 25{\%}, depending on model calibration. The model predicted faster spill progressions than observed, and predicted spills are often wider and less elongated than observed. Model prediction shortcomings are caused by the inability to describe finger formation due to neglecting surface tension in the model. Future spill model formulations require inclusion of surface tension effects to describe fingering. Nonetheless, the spill experiments show that the spill model captures the primary physical relationships between liquid and soil properties controlling spill progression},

@article{Bates2000,
abstract = {In this paper the development of a new model for simulating flood inundation is outlined. The model is designed to operate with high-resolution raster Digital Elevation Models, which are becoming increasingly available for many lowland floodplain rivers and is based on what we hypothesise to he the simplest possible process representation capable of simulating dynamic flood inundation. This consists of a one-dimensional kinematic wave approximation for channel flow solved using an explicit finite difference scheme and a two-dimensional diffusion wave representation of floodplain flow. The model is applied to a 35 km reach of the River Meuse in The Netherlands using only published data sources and used to simulate a large flood event that occurred in January 1995. This event was chosen as air photo and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for flood inundation extent are available to enable rigorous validation of the developed model. 100, 50 and 25 m resolution models were constructed and compared to two other inundation prediction techniques: a planar approximation to the free surface and a relatively coarse resolution two-dimensional finite element scheme. The model developed in this paper outperforms both the simpler and more complex process representations, with the best fit simulation correctly predicting 81.9{\%} of inundated and non-inundated areas. This compares with 69.5{\%} for the best fit planar surface and 63.8{\%} for the best fit finite element code. However, when applied solely to the 7 km of river below the upstream gauging station at Borgharen the planar model performs almost as well (83.7{\%} correct) as the raster model (85.5{\%} correct). This is due to the proximity of the gauge, which acts as a control point for construction of the planar surface and the fact that here low-lying areas of the floodplain an hydraulically connected to the channel. Importantly though it is impossible to generalise such application rules and thus we cannot specify a priori when the planar approximation will work. Simulations also indicate that, for this event at least, dynamic effects are relatively unimportant for prediction of peak inundation. Lastly, consideration of errors in typically available gauging station and inundation extent data shows the raster-based model to be close to the current prediction limit for this class of problem.},

abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

@article{Yoon2009,
abstract = {North American railroads transport a wide variety of chemicals, chemical mixtures and solutions in railroad tank cars. In the event of an accident, these materials may be spilled and impact the environment. Among the chemicals commonly transported are a number of light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs). If these are spilled they can contaminate soil and groundwater and result in costly cleanups. Railroads need a means of objectively assessing the relative risk to the environment due to spills of these different materials. Environmental models are often used to determine the extent of contamination, and the associated environmental risks. For LNAPL spills, these models must account for NAPL infiltration and redistribution, NAPL dissolution and volatilization, and remediation systems such as pump and treat. This study presents the development and application of an environmental screening model to assess NAPL infiltration and redistribution in soils and groundwater, and to assess groundwater cleanup time using a pumping system. Model simulations use parameters and conditions representing LNAPL releases from railroad tank cars. To take into account unique features of railroad-tank-car spill sites, the hydrocarbon spill screening model (HSSM), which assumes a circular surface spill area and a circular NAPL lens, was modified to account for a rectangular spill area and corresponding lens shape at the groundwater table, as well as the effects of excavation and NAPL evaporation to the atmosphere. The modified HSSM was first used to simulate NAPL infiltration and redistribution. A NAPL dissolution and groundwater transport module, and a pumping system module were then implemented and used to simulate the effects of chemical properties, excavation, and free NAPL removal on NAPL redistribution and cleanup time. The amount of NAPL that reached the groundwater table was greater in coarse sand with high permeability than in fine sand or silt with lower permeabilities. Excavation can reduce the amount of NAPL that reaches the groundwater more effectively in lower permeability soils. The effect of chemical properties including vapor pressure and the ratio of density to viscosity become more important in fine sand and silt soil due to slow NAPL movement in the vadose zone. As expected, a pumping system was effective for high solubility chemicals, but it was not effective for low solubility chemicals due to rate-limited mass transfer by transverse dispersion and flow bypassing. Free NAPL removal can improve the removal efficiency for moderately low solubility chemicals like benzene, but cleanup times even after free NAPL removal can be prolonged for very low solubility chemicals like cyclohexane and styrene. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Hussein2002,
abstract = {Overflows and leakage from aboveground storage tanks and pipelines carrying crude oil and petroleum products occur frequently. The spilled hydrocarbons pose environmental threats by contaminating the surrounding soil and the underlying ground water. Predicting the fate and transport of these chemicals is required for environmental risk assessment and for remedial measure design. The present paper discusses the formulation and application of the Oil Surface Flow Screening Model (OILSFSM) for predicting the surface flow of oil by taking into account infiltration and evaporation. Surface flow is simulated using a semi-analytical model based on the lubrication theory approximation of viscous flow. Infiltration is simulated using a version of the Green and Ampt infiltration model, which is modified to account for oil properties. Evaporation of volatile compounds is simulated using a compositional model that accounts for the changes in the fraction of each compound in the spilled oil. The coupling between surface flow, infiltration and evaporation is achieved by incorporating the infiltration and evaporation fluxes into the global continuity equation of the spilled oil. The model was verified against numerical models for infiltration and analytical models for surface flow. The verification study demonstrates the applicability of the model. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Guo2006,
abstract = {Along the asphalt production line, the hot asphalt oil needs to undergo a cooling process that involves temporary storage in a tank. Safety is always a concern as to what if the tank is ruptured. Scenario studies of asphalt oil spills are required when designing the layout and open space for such a cooling process in the refinery yard. Applying the laminar flow theory to an asphalt oil spill, this paper presents an overland flow model to calculate the possible range of spread. The major parameters used in this model include fluid viscosity, ground slope, hydraulic conveyance, and asphalt oil volume. As a simplified model for a quasi-steady state flow condition, a hot asphalt oil spill for a typical case in a refinery yard can run approximately 400 to 600 feet before the asphalt mass cools down and becomes solid-like. {\textcopyright} 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},
