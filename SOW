# Statement of Work

G2 Integrated Solutions ([G2-IS](https://g2-is.com)) would like to upgrade their capacity to simulate spreading of oil products from pipeline breakage events.
Such simulations may be part of the analysis aimed at understanding the potential damage from release of liquid hydrocarbons, 
which federal regulators require of interstate pipeline operators. 
A current simplified model uses the steepest route on a topography, obtained using the 
[ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/about-arcgis/overview) mapping platform.
